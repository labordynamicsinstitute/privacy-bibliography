  title: 'Differential Privacy: A Primer for a Non-Technical Audience'
  title-short: Differential Privacy
  container-title: Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment and Technology Law
  volume: '21'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Differential privacy is a formal mathematical framework for quantifying
    and managing privacy risks. It provides provable privacy protection against a
    wide range of potential attacks, including those currently unforeseen. Differential
    privacy is primarily studied in the context of the collection, analysis, and release
    of aggregate statistics. These range from simple statistical estimations, such
    as averages, to machine learning. Tools for differentially private analysis are
    now in early stages of implementation and use across a variety of academic, industry,
    and government settings. Interest in the concept is growing among potential users
    of the tools, as well as within legal and policy communities, as it holds promise
    as a potential approach to satisfying legal requirements for privacy protection
    when handling personal information. In particular, differential privacy may be
    seen as a technical solution for analyzing and sharing data while protecting the
    privacy of individuals in accordance with existing legal or policy requirements
    for de-identification or disclosure limitation.This primer seeks to introduce
    the concept of differential privacy and its privacy implications to non-technical
    audiences. It provides a simplified and informal, but mathematically accurate,
    description of differential privacy. Using intuitive illustrations and limited
    mathematical formalism, it discusses the definition of differential privacy, how
    differential privacy addresses privacy risks, how differentially private analyses
    are constructed, and how such analyses can be used in practice. A series of illustrations
    is used to show how practitioners and policymakers can conceptualize the guarantees
    provided by differential privacy. These illustrations are also used to explain
    related concepts, such as composition (the accumulation of risk across multiple
    analyses), privacy loss parameters, and privacy budgets. This primer aims to provide
    a foundation that can guide future decisions when analyzing and sharing statistical
    data about individuals, informing individuals about the privacy protection they
    will be afforded, and designing policies and regulations for robust privacy protection.

  abstract: Abstract Commonly accepted hypotheses guide practical determination of
    needed data quality; for example, as the probability that a decision uses data
    increases, the needed data quality increases, and the more rudimentary the uses
    of the data, the less data quality is needed. These hypotheses are formally defined
    and analyzed in some decision-theoretic models. Conditions under which the hypotheses
    hold and fail are examined. Particular attention is given to determining needed
    data quality when the users of the data behave nonoptimally.

  volume: '8'

  abstract: At a time when public confidence in the Federal government is at an all-time
    low, Federal statistical agencies were interested in knowing whether their image
    would suffer as well. Using data gathered in the Gallup Daily Poll to answer this
    question, we found that, as level of knowledge about federal statistics increases
    and for data users, respondents’ discrimination among government entities seems
    to increase – the strength of the relationships between confidence in the Federal
    Statistical System, on one hand, and in Congress and the Military, on the other,
    decreases. In a time when confidence in Congress is particularly poor, increasing
    knowledge about the statistical system and increasing the public’s use of statistical
    data, through programs like "Statistics in Schools" could help people differentiate
    between sectors of the government, thus increasing confidence in the Federal Statistical
    System.

  abstract: In Section 1 the nature of statistical confidentiality is explored, i.e.,
    its essential role in the collection of data by statistical offices, its relationship
    to privacy and the need for increased attention to potential statistical disclosures
    because of the increased tabulation and dissemination capabilities of statistical
    offices. In Section 2 a definition of inadvertent direct disclosure is provided
    as well as a theorem concerning a test for residual disclosure of tabulations.
    In Section 3 different media and methods of data dissemination are considered
    from the point of view of potential for statistical disclosure.

  title: A multiplicative weights mechanism for privacy-preserving data analysis
  container-title: 2010 IEEE 51st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science
  publisher: IEEE Computer Society
  publisher-place: Los Alamitos, CA, USA
  page: 61-70
  abstract: We consider statistical data analysis in the interactive setting. In this
    setting a trusted curator maintains a database of sensitive information about
    individual participants, and releases privacy-preserving answers to queries as
    they arrive. Our primary contribution is a new differentially private multiplicative
    weights mechanism for answering a large number of interactive counting (or linear)
    queries that arrive online and may be adaptively chosen. This is the first mechanism
    with worst-case accuracy guarantees that can answer large numbers of interactive
    queries and is efficient (in terms of the runtime’s dependence on the data universe
    size). The error is asymptotically optimal in its dependence on the number of
    participants, and depends only logarithmically on the number of queries being
    answered. The running time is nearly linear in the size of the data universe.
    As a further contribution, when we relax the utility requirement and require accuracy
    only for databases drawn from a rich class of databases, we obtain exponential
    improvements in running time. Even in this relaxed setting we continue to guarantee
    privacy for any input database. Only the utility requirement is relaxed. Specifically,
    we show that when the input database is drawn from a smooth distribution - a distribution
    that does not place too much weight on any single data item - accuracy remains
    as above, and the running time becomes poly-logarithmic in the data universe size.
    The main technical contributions are the application of multiplicative weights
    techniques to the differential privacy setting, a new privacy analysis for the
    interactive setting, and a technique for reducing data dimensionality for databases
    drawn from smooth distributions.

  title: Bayesian multiscale multiple imputation with implications for data confidentiality
  container-title: Journal of the American Statistical Association
  page: 564-577
  volume: '105'
  issue: '490'
  abstract: Many scientific, sociological, and economic applications present data
    that are collected on multiple scales of resolution. One particular form of multiscale
    data arises when data are aggregated across different scales both longitudinally
    and by economic sector. Frequently, such datasets experience missing observations
    in a manner that they can be accurately imputed, while respecting the constraints
    imposed by the multiscale nature of the data, using the method we propose known
    as Bayesian multiscale multiple imputation. Our approach couples dynamic linear
    models with a novel imputation step based on singular normal distribution theory.
    Although our method is of independent interest, one important implication of such
    methodology is its potential effect on confidential databases protected by means
    of cell suppression. In order to demonstrate the proposed methodology and to assess
    the effectiveness of disclosure practices in longitudinal databases, we conduct
    a large-scale empirical study using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly
    Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). During the course of our empirical investigation
    it is determined that several of the predicted cells are within 1% accuracy, thus
    causing potential concerns for data confidentiality.

  volume: '1'

  abstract: In this article, we show using two simple attacks that a k-anonymized
    dataset has some subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover
    the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive
    attributes. This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge,
    and we show that k-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using
    background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we
    propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called L-diversity that can defend
    against such attacks. In addition to building a formal foundation for L-diversity,
    we show in an experimental evaluation that L-diversity is practical and can be
    implemented efficiently.

    Individuals</span>
  container-title: Proceedings of the 5th Conference on Innovations in Theoretical
    Computer Science
  page: 411-422
  abstract: We prove new positive and negative results concerning the existence of
    truthful and individually rational mechanisms for purchasing private data from
    individuals with unbounded and sensitive privacy preferences. We strengthen the
    impossibility results of Ghosh and Roth (EC 2011) by extending it to a much wider
    class of privacy valuations. In particular, these include privacy valuations that
    are based on ({$\backslash$epsilon}, {$\backslash$delta})-differentially private
    mechanisms for non-zero {$\backslash$delta}, ones where the privacy costs are
    measured in a per-database manner (rather than taking the worst case), and ones
    that do not depend on the payments made to players (which might not be observable
    to an adversary). To bypass this impossibility result, we study a natural special
    setting where individuals have mono- tonic privacy valuations, which captures
    common contexts where certain values for private data are expected to lead to
    higher valuations for privacy (e.g. having a particular disease). We give new
    mech- anisms that are individually rational for all players with monotonic privacy
    valuations, truthful for all players whose privacy valuations are not too large,
    and accurate if there are not too many players with too-large privacy valuations.
    We also prove matching lower bounds showing that in some respects our mechanism
    cannot be improved significantly.

  abstract: The enormous increase in interest in privacy in our society is evident
    in the public press and in the statute books. In some respects this interest in
    privacy is paradoxical, for the average citizen has more privacy-more areas of
    his life in which his behavior is not known by his fellows-than ever before. He
    lives in a large city, where no one is his keeper; in the small towns of former
    times privacy was won only by the cleverest people. He works in large organizations,
    and indeed he (or, more likely, some self-appointed spokesman) laments his alienation.
    He can shake off most of his past simply by moving-to the South, the West-and
    no earlier generation except the immigrant waves before World War I was as mobile.

  abstract: I investigate consumer privacy and the market for customer information
    in electronic retailing. The value of customer information derives from the ability
    of Internet firms to identify individual consumers and charge them personalized
    prices. I study two settings, a confidential regime in which the sale of customer
    information is not possible, and a disclosure regime in which one firm may compile
    and sell a customer list to another firm that uses it to price discriminate. Welfare
    comparisons depend critically on whether consumers anticipate sale of the list
    and on demand elasticity.

  abstract: 'Much has been written about the difficulties that “information” poses
    for neoclassical economics. How ironic that ICE-information, communication, and
    entertainment-now comprises the largest sector in the American economy. If information
    poses problems for economic theory, so much the worse for economic theory: real
    markets seem to deal with information rather well. This paradox is the central
    theme of this essay: information, that slippery and strange economic good, is,
    in fact, handled very well by market institutions. The reason is that real markets
    are much more creative than those simple competitive markets studied in Econ 1.
    The fact that real-life markets can handle a good as problematic as is a testament
    to the flexibility and robustness of market institutions.'

  abstract: In most countries, national statistical agencies do not release establishment-level
    business microdata, because doing so represents too large a risk to establishments’
    confidentiality. One approach with the potential for overcoming these risks is
    to release synthetic data; that is, the released establishment data are simulated
    from statistical models designed to mimic the distributions of the underlying
    real microdata. In this article, we describe an application of this strategy to
    create a public use file for the Longitudinal Business Database, an annual economic
    census of establishments in the United States comprising more than 20 million
    records dating back to 1976. The U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Internal Revenue
    Service recently approved the release of these synthetic microdata for public
    use, making the synthetic Longitudinal Business Database the first-ever business
    microdata set publicly released in the United States. We describe how we created
    the synthetic data, evaluated analytical validity, and assessed disclosure risk.

  title: Utility cost of formal privacy for releasing national employer-employee statistics
  container-title: Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Management
    of Data
  collection-title: SIGMOD ’17
  publisher: ACM
  abstract: National statistical agencies around the world publish tabular summaries
    based on combined employer-employee (ER-EE) data. The privacy of both individuals
    and business establishments that feature in these data are protected by law in
    most countries. These data are currently released using a variety of statistical
    disclosure limitation (SDL) techniques that do not reveal the exact characteristics
    of particular employers and employees, but lack provable privacy guarantees limiting
    inferential disclosures. In this work, we present novel algorithms for releasing
    tabular summaries of linked ER-EE data with formal, provable guarantees of privacy.
    We show that state-of-the-art differentially private algorithms add too much noise
    for the output to be useful. Instead, we identify the privacy requirements mandated
    by current interpretations of the relevant laws, and formalize them using the
    Pufferfish framework. We then develop new privacy definitions that are customized
    to ER-EE data and satisfy the statutory privacy requirements. We implement the
    experiments in this paper on production data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau.
    An empirical evaluation of utility for these data shows that for reasonable values
    of the privacy-loss parameter $\epsilon\geq$ 1, the additive error introduced
    by our provably private algorithms is comparable, and in some cases better, than
    the error introduced by existing SDL techniques that have no provable privacy
    guarantees. For some complex queries currently published, however, our algorithms
    do not have utility comparable to the existing traditional SDL algorithms. Those
    queries are fodder for future research.

  abstract: Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfully
    applied to a range of data analysis tasks. We describe the matrix mechanism, an
    algorithm for answering a workload of linear counting queries that adapts the
    noise distribution to properties of the provided queries. Given a workload, the
    mechanism uses a different set of queries, called a query strategy, which are
    answered using a standard Laplace or Gaussian mechanism. Noisy answers to the
    workload queries are then derived from the noisy answers to the strategy queries.
    This two-stage process can result in a more complex, correlated noise distribution
    that preserves differential privacy but increases accuracy. We provide a formal
    analysis of the error of query answers produced by the mechanism and investigate
    the problem of computing the optimal query strategy in support of a given workload.
    We show that this problem can be formulated as a rank-constrained semidefinite
    program. We analyze two seemingly distinct techniques proposed in the literature,
    whose similar behavior is explained by viewing them as instances of the matrix
    mechanism. We also describe an extension of the mechanism in which nonnegativity
    constraints are included in the derivation process and provide experimental evidence
    of its efficacy.

  title: Conservative or liberal? Personalized differential privacy
  container-title: 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on Data Engineering
  page: 1023-1034
  abstract: Differential privacy is widely accepted as a powerful framework for providing
    strong, formal privacy guarantees for aggregate data analysis. A limitation of
    the model is that the same level of privacy protection is afforded for all individuals.
    However, it is common that the data subjects have quite different expectations
    regarding the acceptable level of privacy for their data. Consequently, differential
    privacy may lead to insufficient privacy protection for some users, while over-protecting
    others. We argue that by accepting that not all users require the same level of
    privacy, a higher level of utility can often be attained by not providing excess
    privacy to those who do not want it. We propose a new privacy definition called
    personalized differential privacy (PDP), a generalization of differential privacy
    in which users specify a personal privacy requirement for their data. We then
    introduce several novel mechanisms for achieving PDP. Our primary mechanism is
    a general one that automatically converts any existing differentially private
    algorithm into one that satisfies PDP. We also present a more direct approach
    for achieving PDP, inspired by the well-known exponential mechanism. We demonstrate
    our framework through extensive experiments on real and synthetic data.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose the first formal privacy analysis of a data
    anonymization process known as the synthetic data generation, a technique becoming
    popular in the statistics community. The target application for this work is a
    mapping program that shows the commuting patterns of the population of the United
    States. The source data for this application were collected by the U.S. Census
    Bureau, but due to privacy constraints, they cannot be used directly by the mapping
    program. Instead, we generate synthetic data that statistically mimic the original
    data while providing privacy guarantees. We use these synthetic data as a surrogate
    for the original data. We find that while some existing definitions of privacy
    are inapplicable to our target application, others are too conservative and render
    the synthetic data useless since they guard against privacy breaches that are
    very unlikely. Moreover, the data in our target application is sparse, and none
    of the existing solutions are tailored to anonymize sparse data. In this paper,
    we propose solutions to address the above issues.

  page: 2339-2347
  abstract: We present new theoretical results on differentially private data release
    useful with respect to any target class of counting queries, coupled with experimental
    results on a variety of real world data sets. Specifically, we study a simple
    combination of the multiplicative weights approach of \[Hardt and Rothblum, 2010\]
    with the exponential mechanism of \[McSherry and Talwar, 2007\]. The multiplicative
    weights framework allows us to maintain and improve a distribution approximating
    a given data set with respect to a set of counting queries. We use the exponential
    mechanism to select those queries most incorrectly tracked by the current distribution.
    Combing the two, we quickly approach a distribution that agrees with the data
    set on the given set of queries up to small error. The resulting algorithm and
    its analysis is simple, but nevertheless improves upon previous work in terms
    of both error and running time. We also empirically demonstrate the practicality
    of our approach on several data sets commonly used in the statistical community
    for contingency table release.

  abstract: This paper models how regulatory attempts to protect the privacy of consumers’
    data affect the competitive structure of data-intensive industries. Our results
    suggest that the commonly used consent-based approach may disproportionately benefit
    firms that offer a larger scope of services. Therefore, though privacy regulation
    imposes costs on all firms, it is small firms and new firms that are most adversely
    affected. We then show that this negative effect will be particularly severe for
    goods where the price mechanism does not mediate the effect, such as the advertising-supported
    Internet.

  abstract: 'Statistical agencies face a dual mandate to publish accurate statistics
    while protecting respondent privacy. Increasing privacy protection requires decreased
    accuracy. Recognizing this as a resource allocation problem, we propose an economic
    solution: operate where the marginal cost of increasing privacy equals the marginal
    benefit. Our model of production, from computer science, assumes data are published
    using an efficient differentially private algorithm. Optimal choice weighs the
    demand for accurate statistics against the demand for privacy. Examples from U.S. statistical
    programs show how our framework can guide decision-making. Further progress requires
    a better understanding of willingness-to-pay for privacy and statistical accuracy.'
