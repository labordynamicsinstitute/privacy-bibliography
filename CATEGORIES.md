# Categories

This is a list of categories into which we split bibliography entries and their corresponding keyword tags. Note that these categories are not exclusive, and many will overlap.

* Economics of Privacy
* Formal Privacy
* Value of Data
* Value of Privacy
* Public Goods
* Miscellaneous
* Policy Documents
* Official Statistics
* Statistical Disclosure Limitation

Beyond these categories we also divide references as
* Background
* Primary (should be around 5-10 papers)
* Secondary (everything else)

The syllabus will be built by listing all background documents, then grouping together all primary documents within each of the above-mentioned categories. We will also generate a "further reading" appendix with all the secondary documents, also grouped by category. Finally, we will have a brief narrative for each topic that explains why we chose particular paper.
