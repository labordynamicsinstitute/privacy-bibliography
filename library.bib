    abstract = { Abstract In this article, the authors describe a collaboration of the Minnesota Population Center (MPC), the U.S. Census Bureau, and the National Archives and Records Administration to restore the lost data from the 1960 Census. The data survived on refrigerated microfilm in a cave in Lenexa, Kansas. The MPC is now converting the data to usable form. Once the restored data are processed, the authors intend to develop three new data sources based on the 1960 census. These data will replace the most inadequate sample in the series of public-use census microdata spanning the years from 1850 to 2000, extend the chronological scope of the public census summary files, and provide a powerful new resource for the Census Bureau and its Research Data Centers. }

abstract = {The collection and analysis of telemetry data from user’s devices is routinely performed by many software companies. Telemetry collection leads to improved user experience but poses significant risks to users’ privacy. Locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms have recently emerged as the main tool that allows data collectors to estimate various population statistics, while preserving privacy. The guarantees provided by such algorithms are typically very strong for a single round of telemetry collection, but degrade rapidly when telemetry is collected regularly. In particular, existing LDP algorithms are not suitable for repeated collection of counter data such as daily app usage statistics. In this paper, we develop new LDP mechanisms geared towards repeated collection of counter data, with formal privacy guarantees even after being executed for an arbitrarily long period of time. For two basic analytical tasks, mean estimation and histogram estimation, our LDP mechanisms for repeated data collection provide estimates with comparable or even the same accuracy as existing single-round LDP collection mechanisms. We conduct empirical evaluation on real-world counter datasets to verify our theoretical results. Our mechanisms have been deployed by a Fortune 500 company to collect telemetry across millions of devices.},

The Secretary of Commerce decided not to adjust, however. Those decisions relied at least partly on the Census Bureau's analyses of the accuracy of the census and of the proposed undercount adjustments based on the Post-Enumeration Survey (PES). Error distributions for the nation, states, and smaller geographic units were estimated with extensions of methods applied to test censuses. To summarize and assess the relative importance of errors in different units, the Census Bureau used aggregate loss functions. This article describes the total error analysis and loss function analysis of the Census Bureau. In its decision not to adjust the census, the Department of Commerce cited different criteria than aggregate loss functions. Those criteria are identified and discussed.},

We apply the methodology to the 1988 dress rehearsal census of St. Louis and east-central Missouri and we discuss its applicability to the 1990 census and PES. The methodology is based on decompositions of the total (or net) error into components, such as sampling error, matching error, and other nonsampling errors. Limited information about the accuracy of certain components of error, notably failure of assumptions in the "capture-recapture" model, but others as well, lead us to offer tentative estimates of the errors of the census, DSE, and undercount estimates for 1988. Improved estimates are anticipated for 1990.},

In such cases the individuals may elect not to reply at all or to reply with incorrect answers. The resulting evasive answer bias is ordinarily difficult to assess. In this paper it is argued that such bias is potentially removable through allowing the interviewee to maintain privacy through the device of randomizing his response. A randomized response method for estimating a population proportion is presented as an example. Unbiased maximum likelihood estimates are obtained and their mean square errors of conventional estimates under various assumptions about the underlying population.},

Consistent with the Law of Small Numbers (LSN), participants exaggerated the likelihood that short sequences and random subsets of coin flips would be balanced between heads and tails. Consistent with the Non-Belief in the Law of Large Numbers (NBLLN), participants underestimated the likelihood that large samples would be close to 50\% heads. However, we identify some shortcomings of existing models of LSN, and we find that NBLLN may not be as stable as previous studies suggest. We also find evidence for exact representativeness (ER), whereby people tend to exaggerate the likelihood that samples will (nearly) exactly mirror the underlying odds, as an additional bias beyond LSN. Our within-subject design of asking many different questions about the same data lets us disentangle the biases from possible rational alternative interpretations by showing that the biases lead to inconsistency in answers. Our design also centers on identifying and controlling for bin effects, whereby the probability assigned to outcomes systematically depends on the categories used to elicit beliefs in a way predicted by support theory. The bin effects are large and systematic and affect some results, but we find LSN, NBLLN, and ER even after controlling for them.},

abstract="Differential privacy is a notion of privacy that has become very popular in the database community. Roughly, the idea is that a randomized query mechanism provides sufficient privacy protection if the ratio between the probabilities that two adjacent datasets give the same answer is bound by e                              $\epsilon$              . In the field of information flow there is a similar concern for controlling information leakage, i.e. limiting the possibility of inferring the secret information from the observables. In recent years, researchers have proposed to quantify the leakage in terms of min-entropy leakage, a concept strictly related to the Bayes risk. In this paper, we show how to model the query system in terms of an information-theoretic channel, and we compare the notion of differential privacy with that of min-entropy leakage. We show that differential privacy implies a bound on the min-entropy leakage, but not vice-versa. Furthermore, we show that our bound is tight. Then, we consider the utility of the randomization mechanism, which represents how close the randomized answers are to the real ones, in average. We show that the notion of differential privacy implies a bound on utility, also tight, and we propose a method that under certain conditions builds an optimal randomization mechanism, i.e. a mechanism which provides the best utility while guaranteeing $\epsilon$-differential privacy.",

It is argued that the market failure is associated with the inability of prices to convey information about the value attached to quality by inframarginal consumers. In the regulatory context, this market problem appears in the form of a difficult informational question for the regulator; what is the average valuation of quality over all the consumers in the market? The paper suggests that rate-of-return regulation may have attractive features when quality is a variable.},

We consider the determination of the optimal expenditure in some simple situations when only some aspects of the data use are known. In particular, we consider uses where an action is taken if a statistic exceeds a threshold $\tau$?, which is unknown at the time of data planning and collection (though its value will not depend on the value of the statistic). We analyze the sensitivity of the optimal expenditure to the a priori uncertainty in $\tau$?. For many decision problems, the optimal expenditure decreases with increasing uncertainty about $\tau$?, but we identify some uses for which the optimal expenditure increases with increasing uncertainty about $\tau$?. We also study the effects of other forms of ambiguity. Uncertainty about whether the data will be used typically decreases the optimal expenditure, as does uncertainty about the preferences represented in the decision making. }

We find that, both for men and women, their spouse's access to information does not affect efficiency. However, they are willing to sacrifice much efficiency for greater personal control over household income. Intriguingly, even when spouses' control over household income is exogenously assigned, inefficiency persists: As a wife's assigned share increases, husbands undercut their own income to reduce hers. This self-destructive and spiteful behavior is best explained by non-economic factors such as identity, seldom emphasized in mainstream household economic models.},

The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study. },

Instead of simulating the sampling distribution of a statistic estimating a parameter, the Bayesian bootstrap simulates the posterior distribution of the parameter; operationally and inferentially the methods are quite similar. Because both methods of drawing inferences are based on somewhat peculiar model assumptions and the resulting inferences are generally sensitive to these assumptions, neither method should be applied without some consideration of the reasonableness of these model assumptions. In this sense, neither method is a true bootstrap procedure yielding inferences unaided by external assumptions.},

 more than five hundred thousand employing firms. We decompose real
 total annual compensation per worker into components related to observable
 employee characteristics, personal heterogeneity, firm heterogeneity,
 and residual variation. Except for the residual, all components may
 be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. At the level of the individual,
 we find that person effects, especiallythose not related to observables
 like education, are a very important source of wage variation in
 France. Firm effects, while important, are not as important as person
 effects. At the level of firms, we find that enterprises that hire
 high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable. They
 are also more capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises
 that pay higher wages, controlling for person effects, are more productive
 and more profitable. They are also more capital intensive but are
 not more high-skilled labor intensive. We find that person effects
 explain about 90\% of inter-industry wage differentials and about
 75\% of the firm-size wage effect while firm effects explain relatively
 little of either differential.},

Specifically, we address the following question. Since the primary task in data mining is the development of models about aggregated data, can we develop accurate models without access to precise information in individual data records? We consider the concrete case of building a decision-tree classifier from training data in which the values of individual records have been perturbed. The resulting data records look very different from the original records and the distribution of data values is also very different from the original distribution. While it is not possible to accurately estimate original values in individual data records, we propose a novel reconstruction procedure to accurately estimate the distribution of original data values. By using these reconstructed distributions, we are able to build classifiers whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of classifiers built with the original data.},

Apart from the aggregation problem itself, a reasonable explanation for these differences may be that omitted factors cause a different bias in aggregate data than in micro-data. One obvious omitted factor in micro-studies is the interdependence of preferences. The fact that consumer preferences are influenced by the behaviour of others is well-documented in the psychological and sociological literature, yet it is almost universally ignored in micro-studies of consumer demand. Although preference interdependence is not accounted for explicitly in studies based on macro data, it can be said to play a role implicitly: to the extent that the consumption of the Jones' influences the consumption of the Browns and vice versa, these external effects show up in aggregate data since these reflect the consumption of both the Jones' and the Browns.},

We demonstrate that such formal modeling has only limited use in explaining the value of legal evidence, much more limited than those investigators who construct and discuss the models assume, and thus that the conclusions they draw about the value of evidence are unwarranted. This is done through a discussion of several recent examples that attempt to quantify evidence relating to carpet fibers, infidelity, DNA random match evidence, and character evidence used to impeach a witness. This paper makes the following contributions. Most important, it is another demonstration of the complex relationship between algorithmic tools and legal decision making. Furthermore, at a minimum it highlights the need for both analytical and empirical work to accommodate the reference class problem and the risk of failing to do so. - Copyright 2007 The University of Chicago},

In many settings such as these privacy is not only ethically mandated, but frequently legally as well. Consequently there is an extensive and diverse literature dedicated to the problems of statistical disclosure control in contingency table release. However, all current techniques for reporting contingency tables fall short on at leas one of privacy, accuracy, and consistency (among multiple released tables). We propose a solution that provides strong guarantees for all three desiderata simultaneously. Our approach can be viewed as a special case of a more general approach for producing synthetic data: Any privacy-preserving mechanism for contingency table release begins with raw data and produces a (possibly inconsistent) privacy-preserving set of marginals. From these tables alone-and hence without weakening privacy--we will find and output the "nearest" consistent set of marginals. Interestingly, this set is no farther than the tables of the raw data, and consequently the additional error introduced by the imposition of consistency is no more than the error introduced by the privacy mechanism itself. The privacy mechanism of [20] gives the strongest known privacy guarantees, with very little error. Combined with the techniques of the current paper, we therefore obtain excellent privacy, accuracy, and consistency among the tables. Moreover, our techniques are surprisingly efficient. Our techniques apply equally well to the logical cousin of the contingency table, the OLAP cube.},

Section 3 develops further implications and applications in the context of analyzing intra-family relations, charitable behavior, merit goods and multi-persons interactions, and envy and hatred. The variety and significance of these applications is persuasive testimony not only to the importance of social interactions, but also to the feasibility of incorporating them into a rigorous analysis.},

A small redistribution of wealth among the contributing consumers will not change the equilibrium amount of the public good. However, larger redistributions of wealth will change the set of contributors and thereby change the equilibrium provision of the public good. We are able to characterize the properties and the comparative statics of the equilibrium in a quite complete way and to analyze the extent to which government provision of a public good crowds out private contributions.},

  abstract  = {We adopt a utilitarian perspective on social choice, assuming that agents have (possibly latent) utility func- tions over some space of alternatives. For many reasons one might consider mechanisms, or social choice functions, that only have access to the ordinal rankings of alternatives by the individual agents rather than their utility functions. In this context, one possible objective for a social choice function is the maximiza- tion of (expected) social welfare relative to the information contained in these rankings. We study such optimal social choice functions under three different models, and underscore the important role played by scoring functions. In our worst-case model, no assumptions are made about the underlying distribution and we analyze the worst-case distortion--or degree to which the selected alternative does not maximize social welfare--of optimal social choice functions. In our average-case model, we derive optimal functions under neutral (or impartial culture) distributional models. Finally, a very general learning-theoretic model allows for the computation of optimal social choice functions (i.e., that maximize expected social welfare) under arbitrary, sampleable distributions. In the latter case, we provide both algorithms and sample complexity results for the class of scoring functions, and further validate the approach empirically.

Models with additive fixed effects for workers and establishments are fit into four subintervals spanning the period from 1985 to 2009. We show that these models provide a good approximation to the wage structure and can explain nearly all of the dramatic rise in West German wage inequality. Our estimates suggest that the increasing dispersion of West German wages has arisen from a combination of rising heterogeneity between workers, rising dispersion in the wage premiums at different establishments, and increasing assortativeness in the assignment of workers to plants. In contrast, the idiosyncratic job-match component of wage variation is small and stable over time. Decomposing changes in mean wages between different education groups, occupations, and industries, we find that increasing plant-level heterogeneity and rising assortativeness in the assignment of workers to establishments explain a large share of the rise in inequality along all three dimensions.

This approach differs from much (but not all!) of the related literature in the statistics, databases, theory, and cryptography communities, in that a formal and ad omnia privacy guarantee is defined, and the data analysis techniques presented are rigorously proved to satisfy the guarantee. The key privacy guarantee that has emerged is differential privacy. Roughly speaking, this ensures that (almost, and quantifiably) no risk is incurred by joining a statistical database. In this survey, we recall the definition of differential privacy and two basic techniques for achieving it. We then show some interesting applications of these techniques, presenting algorithms for three specific tasks and three general results on differentially private learning.},

We provide general techniques to produce privacy-preserving approximations of classifiers learned via (regularized) empirical risk minimization (ERM). These algorithms are private under the {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$}-differential privacy definition due to Dwork et al. (2006). First we apply the output perturbation ideas of Dwork et al. (2006), to ERM classification. Then we propose a new method, objective perturbation, for privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm design. This method entails perturbing the objective function before optimizing over classifiers. If the loss and regularizer satisfy certain convexity and differentiability criteria, we prove theoretical results showing that our algorithms preserve privacy, and provide generalization bounds for linear and nonlinear kernels. We further present a privacy-preserving technique for tuning the parameters in general machine learning algorithms, thereby providing end-to-end privacy guarantees for the training process. We apply these results to produce privacy-preserving analogues of regularized logistic regression and support vector machines. We obtain encouraging results from evaluating their performance on real demographic and benchmark data sets. Our results show that both theoretically and empirically, objective perturbation is superior to the previous state-of-the-art, output perturbation, in managing the inherent tradeoff between privacy and learning performance.},

In a time when confidence in Congress is particularly poor, increasing knowledge about the statistical system and increasing the public's use of statistical data, through programs like "Statistics in Schools" could help people differentiate between sectors of the government, thus increasing confidence in the Federal Statistical System.},

Practical databases accommodate users with heterogeneous needs for access. Each class of data user is accorded access to only certain views. Other views are considered confidential, and hence to be protected. Using illustrations from health care and education, this article addresses inferential disclosure of confidential views in multidimensional categorical databases. It demonstrates that any structural, so data-value-independent method for detecting disclosure can fail. Consistent with previous work for two-way tables, it presents a data-value-dependent method to obtain tight lower and upper bounds for confidential data values. For two-dimensional projections of categorical databases, it exploits the network structure of a linear programming (LP) formulation to develop two transportation flow algorithms that are both computationally efficient and insightful. These algorithms can be easily implemented through two new matrix operators, cell-maxima and cell-minima. Collectively, this method is called matrix comparative assignment (MCA). Finally, it extends both the LP and MCA approaches to inferential disclosure when accessible views have been masked.},

This paper suggests that these two findings are consistent with the presence of relative income terms in the utility function. Income may be evaluated relative to others (social comparison) or to oneself in the past (habituation). We review the evidence on relative income from the subjective well-being literature. We also discuss the relation (or not) between happiness and utility, and discuss some nonhappiness research (behavioral, experimental, neurological) related to income comparisons. We last consider how relative income in the utility function can affect economic models of behavior in the domains Of consumption, investment, economic growth, savings, taxation, labor supply, wages, and migration.},

We model a statistical database by an n-bit string d1,..,dn, with a query being a subset q n to be answered by $\Sigma$i$\epsilon$q di. Our main result is a polynomial reconstruction algorithm of data from noisy (perturbed) subset sums. Applying this reconstruction algorithm to statistical databases we show that in order to achieve privacy one has to add perturbation of magnitude ($\Omega$n). That is, smaller perturbation always results in a strong violation of privacy. We show that this result is tight by exemplifying access algorithms for statistical databases that preserve privacy while adding perturbation of magnitude {\~{O}}(n).For time-T bounded adversaries we demonstrate a privacypreserving access algorithm whose perturbation magnitude is T.},

Whether a data user or intruder attempts to obtain confidential information from a public-use file depends on the perceived costs of identifying a record, the perceived probability of success, and the information expected to be gained. In this article, a decision-theoretic framework for risk assessment that includes the intruder's objectives and strategy for compromising the data base and the information gained by the intruder is developed. Two kinds of microdata disclosure are distinguished--disclosure of a respondent's identity and disclosure of a respondent's attributes as a result of an unauthorized identification. A formula for the risk of identity disclosure is given, and a simple approximation to it is evaluated.},

In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy. 1},

The main conceptual contribution of this paper is a framework for fair classification comprising (1) a (hypothetical) task-specific metric for determining the degree to which individuals are similar with respect to the classification task at hand; (2) an algorithm for maximizing utility subject to the fairness constraint, that similar individuals are treated similarly. We also present an adaptation of our approach to achieve the complementary goal of "fair affirmative action," which guarantees statistical parity (i.e., the demographics of the set of individuals receiving any classification are the same as the demographics of the underlying population), while treating similar individuals as similarly as possible. Finally, we discuss the relationship of fairness to privacy: when fairness implies privacy, and how tools developed in the context of differential privacy may be applied to fairness.},

In a recent paper, Barak et al. extend this approach to the release of a specified set of margins from a multi-way contingency table. Privacy protection in such settings implicitly focuses on small cell counts that might allow for the identification of units that are unique in the database. We explore how well the mechanism works in the context of a series of examples, and the extent to which the proposed differential-privacy mechanism allows for sensible inferences from the released data. We conclude that the methodology, as it is currently formulated, is problematic in the context of the types of large sparse contingency tables encountered in statistical practice.},

Up to this point, research on differentially private data analysis has focused on the setting of a trusted curator holding a large, static, data set; thus every computation is a "one-shot" object: there is no point in computing something twice, since the result will be unchanged, up to any randomness introduced for privacy. However, many applications of data analysis involve repeated computations, either because the entire goal is one of monitoring, e.g., of traffic conditions, search trends, or incidence of influenza, or because the goal is some kind of adaptive optimization, e.g., placement of data to minimize access costs. In these cases, the algorithm must permit continual observation of the system's state. We therefore initiate a study of differential privacy under continual observation. We identify the problem of maintaining a counter in a privacy preserving manner and show its wide applicability to many different problems.},

The sanitization may be in the form of an arbitrary data structure, accompanied by a computational procedure for determining approximate answers to queries on the original data set, or it may be a "synthetic data set" consisting of data items drawn from the same universe as items in the original data set; queries are carried out as if the synthetic data set were the actual input. In either case the process is non-interactive; once the sanitization has been released the original data and the curator play no further role. For the task of sanitizing with a synthetic dataset output, we map the boundary between computational feasibility and infeasibility with respect to a variety of utility measures. For the (potentially easier) task of sanitizing with unrestricted output format, we show a tight qualitative and quantitative connection between hardness of sanitizing and the existence of traitor tracing schemes.},

 a trusted database administrator monitors queries and introduces noise to the

 of breach of privacy, Dinur and Nissim proved that unless the total number of
 queries is sub-linear in the size of the database, a substantial amount of noise
 is required to avoid a breach, rendering the database almost useless.</p>

 <p>As databases grow increasingly large, the possibility of being able to query
 only a sub-linear number of times becomes realistic. We further investigate this
 situation, generalizing the previous work in two important directions:
 multi-attribute databases (previous work dealt only with single-attribute
 databases) and vertically partitioned databases, in which different subsets of
 attributes are stored in different databases. In addition, we show how to use our
 techniques for datamining on published noisy statistics.</p>},

  abstract  = {In a recent paper Dinur and Nissim considered a statistical database in which a trusted database administrator monitors queries and introduces noise to the responses with the goal of maintaining data privacy [5]. Under a rigorous definition of breach of privacy, Dinur and Nissim proved that unless the total number of queries is sub-linear in the size of the database, a substantial amount of noise is required to avoid a breach, rendering the database almost useless. As databases grow increasingly large, the possibility of being able to query only a sub-linear number of times becomes realistic. We further investigate this situation, generalizing the previous work in two impor- tant directions: multi-attribute databases (previous work dealt only with single-attribute databases) and vertically partitioned databases, in which different subsets of attributes are stored in different databases. In addi- tion, we show how to use our techniques for datamining on published noisy statistics.},

In short, RAPPORs allow the forest of client data to be studied, without permitting the possibility of looking at individual trees. By applying randomized response in a novel manner, RAPPOR provides the mechanisms for such collection as well as for efficient, high-utility analysis of the collected data. In particular, RAPPOR permits statistics to be collected on the population of client-side strings with strong privacy guarantees for each client, and without linkability of their reports. This paper describes and motivates RAPPOR, details its differential-privacy and utility guarantees, discusses its practical deployment and properties in the face of different attack models, and, finally, gives results of its application to both synthetic and real-world data.},

  year      = {2012},
  pages     = {160--179},
  abstract  = {We want to publish low-dimensional points, for example 2D spatial points, in a differentially private manner. Most existing mechanisms publish noisy frequency counts of points in a fixed predefined partition. Arguably, histograms with adaptive partition, for example V-optimal and equi-depth histograms, which have smaller bin-widths in denser regions, would provide more statistical information. However, as the adaptive partitions leak significant information about the dataset, it is not clear how differentially private partitions can be published accurately. In this paper, we propose a simple method based on the observation that the sensitivity of publishing the sorted sequence of a dataset is independent of the size of dataset. Together with isotonic regression, the dataset can be reconstructed with high accuracy. One advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity, in the sense that there are only a few parameters to be determined. Furthermore, the parameters can be estimated solely from the privacy requirement $\epsilon$ and the total number of points, and hence do not leak information about the data. Although the parameters are chosen to minimize the earth mover's distance between the published data and original data, empirical studies show that the proposed method also achieves high accuracy w.r.t. to some other measurements, for example range query and order statistics.},

Relative to separate provision mechanisms, the optimal bundling mechanism may increase the asymptotic provision probability of socially efficient public goods from zero to one, and decreases the extent of use exclusions. If the regularity condition is violated, the optimal solution replicates the separate provision outcome for the two-good case. (JEL D82, H41)},

Like all algorithms for this task, ours necessarily has worst-case complexity exponential in the dimension of the data. However, our algorithm packages the computationally hard step into a concisely defined integer program, which can be solved non-privately using standard solvers. We prove accuracy and privacy theorems for our algorithm, and then demonstrate experimentally that our algorithm performs well in practice. For example, our algorithm can efficiently and accurately answer millions of queries on the Netflix dataset, which has over 17,000 attributes; this is an improvement on the state of the art by multiple orders of magnitude.},

  abstract  = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distribution F if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G?=F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster tomake careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed.We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.},

The location data of people who live and work in different regions can be re-identified even more easily. Our results show that the threat of re-identification for location data is much greater when the individual's home and work locations can both be deduced from the data.

We also prove a matching lower bound showing that our guarantee is nearly optimal for every setting of the coherence parameter.

  abstract  = {We consider statistical data analysis in the interactive setting. In this setting a trusted curator maintains a database of sensitive information about individual participants, and releases privacy-preserving answers to queries as they arrive. Our primary contribution is a new differentially private multiplicative weights mechanism for answering a large number of interactive counting (or linear) queries that arrive online and may be adaptively chosen. This is the first mechanism with worst-case accuracy guarantees that can answer large numbers of interactive queries and is efficient (in terms of the runtime's dependence on the data universe size). The error is asymptotically optimal in its dependence on the number of participants, and depends only logarithmically on the number of queries being answered. The running time is nearly linear in the size of the data universe. As a further contribution, when we relax the utility requirement and require accuracy only for databases drawn from a rich class of databases, we obtain exponential improvements in running time. Even in this relaxed setting we continue to guarantee privacy for any input database. Only the utility requirement is relaxed. Specifically, we show that when the input database is drawn from a smooth distribution - a distribution that does not place too much weight on any single data item - accuracy remains as above, and the running time becomes poly-logarithmic in the data universe size. The main technical contributions are the application of multiplicative weights techniques to the differential privacy setting, a new privacy analysis for the interactive setting, and a technique for reducing data dimensionality for databases drawn from smooth distributions.},

  abstract  = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

  abstract  = {Differential privacy has become the dominant standard in the research community for strong privacy protection. There has been a flood of research into query answering algorithms that meet this standard. Algorithms are becoming increasingly complex, and in particular, the performance of many emerging algorithms is {\em data dependent}, meaning the distribution of the noise added to query answers may change depending on the input data. Theoretical analysis typically only considers the worst case, making empirical study of average case performance increasingly important. In this paper we propose a set of evaluation principles which we argue are essential for sound evaluation. Based on these principles we propose DPBench, a novel evaluation framework for standardized evaluation of privacy algorithms. We then apply our benchmark to evaluate algorithms for answering 1- and 2-dimensional range queries. The result is a thorough empirical study of 15 published algorithms on a total of 27 datasets that offers new insights into algorithm behavior---in particular the influence of dataset scale and shape---and a more complete characterization of the state of the art. Our methodology is able to resolve inconsistencies in prior empirical studies and place algorithm performance in context through comparison to simple baselines. Finally, we pose open research questions which we hope will guide future algorithm design.},

Our approach carefully chooses a set of queries to evaluate, and then exploits consistency constraints that should hold over the noisy output. In a post-processing phase, we compute the consistent input most likely to have produced the noisy output. The final output is differentially-private and consistent, but in addition, it is often much more accurate. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these techniques can be used for estimating the degree sequence of a graph very precisely, and for computing a histogram that can support arbitrary range queries accurately.},

  abstract  = {Many scientific, sociological, and economic applications present data that are collected on multiple scales of resolution. One particular form of multiscale data arises when data are aggregated across different scales both longitudinally and by economic sector. Frequently, such datasets experience missing observations in a manner that they can be accurately imputed, while respecting the constraints imposed by the multiscale nature of the data, using the method we propose known as Bayesian multiscale multiple imputation. Our approach couples dynamic linear models with a novel imputation step based on singular normal distribution theory. Although our method is of independent interest, one important implication of such methodology is its potential effect on confidential databases protected by means of cell suppression. In order to demonstrate the proposed methodology and to assess the effectiveness of disclosure practices in longitudinal databases, we conduct a large-scale empirical study using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). During the course of our empirical investigation it is determined that several of the predicted cells are within 1{\%} accuracy, thus causing potential concerns for data confidentiality.},

The experiments reported here tested the social desirability response bias hypothesis directly by implementing a technique that allowed respondents to report secretly whether they voted: the "item count technique." The item count technique significantly reduced turnout reports in a national telephone survey relative to direct self-reports, suggesting that social desirability response bias influenced direct self-reports in that survey. But in eight national surveys of American adults conducted via the Internet, the item count technique did not significantly reduce turnout reports. This mode difference is consistent with other evidence that the Internet survey mode may be less susceptible to social desirability response bias because of self-administration.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a Bayesian model for estimating the joint distribution of multivariate categorical data when units are nested within groups. Such data arise frequently in social science settings, for example, people living in households. The model assumes that (i) each group is a member of a group-level latent class, and (ii) each unit is a member of a unit-level latent class nested within its group-level latent class. This structure allows the model to capture dependence among units in the same group. It also facilitates simultaneous modeling of variables at both group and unit levels. We develop a version of the model that assigns zero probability to groups and units with physically impossible combinations of variables. We apply the model to estimate multivariate relationships in a subset of the American Community Survey. Using the estimated model, we generate synthetic household data that could be disseminated as redacted public use files with high analytic validity and low disclosure risks.

In this survey paper we look into the work done by eminent people on the issue of privacy and its relationship with people, technology and regulation from an economic perspective and its increasing relevance today.

The interdependence of consumption of different households has implications for the stochastic structure of the model and for the identifiability of its parameters. Both aspects are dealt with. The empirical results indicate a significant role played by the interdependence of preferences. One of its implications is that predictions of the effects of changes in a household's exogenous variables differ according to whether the exogenous variable only changes for this household or for all households jointly. 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The first, requires that each agent should be incentivized to report her private information truthfully. The second, privacy, requires the mechanism not reveal `much' about any agent's type to other agents. We propose a notion of privacy we call Joint Differential Privacy. It is a variant of Differential Privacy, a robust notion of privacy used in the Theoretical Computer Science literature. We show by construction that such mechanisms, i.e. ones which are both incentive compatible and jointly differentially private exist when the game is `large', i.e. there are a large number of players, and any player's action affects any other's payoff by at most a small amount. Our mechanism adds carefully selected noise to no-regret algorithms similar to those studied in Foster-Vohra and Hart-Mas-Colell. It therefore implements an approximate correlated equilibrium of the full information game induced by players' reports.},

  abstract  = {Strategic interaction parameters characterize the impact of actions of one economic agent on the payoff of another economic agent. In this paper we study how the in- formation available to economic agents regarding other economic agents can influence the ability of an econometrician to recover strategic information parameters from the observed actions. We consider two extreme cases: the complete information case where the information sets of participating economic agents coincide, and the incomplete in- formation case where each agent has a privately observable type. We find that in models with incomplete information the statistical (Fisher) information for the inter- action parameters is zero, implying that estimation and inference become nonstandard. In contrast, in the incomplete information models with any non-zero variance of player types, the statistical information is positive, implying the existence of regular estima- tors for these parameters converging at the parametric rate. This finding is illustrated in two cases: treatment effect models (expressed as a triangular system of equations), and the static game models. In both types of models the observed discrete outcomes are driven by continuously distributed errors with an unknown distribution (unob- served heterogeneity). We find that the key factor driving the result in these models is the relative tail behavior of the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity of economic agents' payoffs and the distribution of covariates. Our result has important impli- cations for experimental design in economic systems where unobserved heterogeneity plays a major role: a failure to provide sufficient independent randomization of the payoffs of participating agents may lead to non-robustness of estimated parameters to the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity.},

We show how this principle can be made precise in several diverse settings --- in the use of marketing surveys by a vendor designing a product; and in the design of collaborative filtering and recommendation systems, where we seek to quantify the value of each user's participation. Our approach draws on the analysis of coalitional games, making use of the core and Shapley value of such games as fair allocation principles.},

It is a common understanding that histograms that adapt to images can represent their color distributions more efficiently than do histograms with fixed binnings. However, existing systems almost exclusively adopt fixed-binning histograms be- cause, among existing well-known dissimilarity measures, only the computationally expensive Earth Mover?s Distance (EMD) can compare histograms with different binnings. This paper addresses the issue by defining a new dissimilarity measure that is more reliable than the Euclidean distance and yet computationally less expensive than EMD. Moreover, a mathemat- ically sound definition of mean histogram can be defined for histogram clustering applications. Extensive test results show that adaptive histograms produce the best overall performance, in terms of good accuracy, small number of bins, no empty bin, and efficient computation, com- pared to existing methods for histogram retrieval, classification, and clustering tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfully applied to a range of data analysis tasks. But despite much recent work, optimal strategies for answering a collection of related queries are not known.

We propose the matrix mechanism, a new algorithm for answering a workload of predicate counting queries. Given a workload, the mechanism requests answers to a different set of queries, called a query strategy, which are answered using the standard Laplace mechanism. Noisy answers to the workload queries are then derived from the noisy answers to the strategy queries. This two stage process can result in a more complex correlated noise distribution that preserves differential privacy but increases accuracy.

We provide a formal analysis of the error of query answers produced by the mechanism and investigate the problem of computing the optimal query strategy in support of a given workload. We show this problem can be formulated as a rank-constrained semidefinite program. Finally, we analyze two seemingly distinct techniques, whose similar behavior is explained by viewing them as instances of the matrix mechanism.},

Given a workload of counting queries, the mechanism automatically selects a different set of "strategy" queries to answer privately, using those answers to derive answers to the workload. The main algorithm proposed in this paper approximates the optimal strategy for any workload of linear counting queries. With no cost to the privacy guarantee, the mechanism improves significantly on prior approaches and achieves near-optimal error for many workloads, when applied under (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy. The result is an adaptive mechanism which can help users achieve good utility without requiring that they reason carefully about the best formulation of their task.},

In other words, do people care about relative position, and does lagging "behind the Joneses" diminish well-being? To answer this question, I match individual-level data containing various indicators of well-being to information about local average earnings. I find that, controlling for an individual's own income, higher earnings of neighbors are associated with lower levels of self-reported happiness. The data's panel nature and rich set of measures of well-being and behavior indicate that this association is not driven by selection or by changes in the way people define happiness. There is suggestive evidence that the negative effect of increases in neighbors' earnings on own well-being is most likely caused by interpersonal preferences, that is, people having utility functions that depend on relative consumption in addition to absolute consumption. 2005 MIT Press},

The key to defining privacy is to model knowledge of the attacker -- if the attacker is assumed to know too little, the published data can be easily attacked, if the attacker is assumed to know too much, the published data has little utility. Previous work considered either quite ignorant adversaries or nearly omniscient adversaries. In this paper, we introduce a new class of adversaries that we call realistic adversaries who live in the unexplored space in between. Realistic adversaries have knowledge from external sources with an associated stubbornness indicating the strength of their knowledge. We then introduce a novel privacy framework called epsilon-privacy that allows us to guard against realistic adversaries. We also show that prior privacy definitions are instantiations of our framework. In a thorough experimental study with real census data we show that e-privacy allows us to publish data with high utility while defending against strong adversaries.},

It turns out some users had queried their own names, or " vanity queries, " and nearby locations like local businesses. As a result, it was not difficult for reporters to find and interview an AOL user 1 then learn personal details about her (such as age and medical history) from the rest of her queries. Could AOL have protected all its users by also replacing each word in the search queries with a random hash? Probably not; Kumar et al. 27 showed that word co-occurrence patterns would provide clues about which hashes correspond to which words, thus allowing an attacker to partially reconstruct the original queries. Such privacy concerns are not unique to Web-search data. Businesses, government agencies, and research groups routine-ly collect data about individuals and need to release some form of it for a va-riety of reasons (such as meeting legal requirements, satisfying business ob-ligations, and encouraging reproduc-ible scientific research). However, they must also protect sensitive informa-tion, including identities, facts about individuals, trade secrets, and other application-specific considerations, in the raw data. The privacy challenge is that sensitive information can be inferred in many ways from the data releases. Homer et al. 20},

It is found that inference is not possible unless the researcher has prior information specifying the composition of reference groups. If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes. Inference is difficult to impossible if these variables are functionally dependent or are statistically independent. The prospects are better if the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes are moderately related in the population.},

Starting with Call Detail Records (CDRs) from a cellular telephone network that have gone through a straightforward anonymization procedure, the prior WHERE modeling approach produces synthetic CDRs for a synthetic population. The accuracy of WHERE has been validated against billions of location samples for hundreds of thousands of cell phones in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. In this paper, we introduce DP-WHERE, which modifies WHERE by adding controlled noise to achieve differential privacy, a strict definition of privacy that makes no assumptions about the power or background knowledge of a potential adversary. We also present experiments showing that the accuracy of DP-WHERE remains close to that of WHERE and of real CDRs. With this work, we aim to enable the creation and possible release of synthetic models that capture the mobility patterns of real metropolitan populations while preserving privacy.},

We look at a richer model where agents also assign non-negative dis-utility to the information about their private types leaked by the outcome of the mechanism. We present a new model for privacy-aware mechanism design, where we only assume an upper bound on the agents' loss due to leakage, as opposed to previous work where a full characterization of the loss was required. In this model, under a mild assumption on the distribution of how agents value their privacy, we show a generic construction of privacy-aware mechanisms and demonstrate its applicability to electronic polling and pricing of a digital good.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a new, generic framework for private data analysis. The goal of private data analysis is to release aggregate information about a data set while protecting the privacy of the individuals whose information the data set contains. Our framework allows one to release functions f of the data with instance-based additive noise. That is, the noise magnitude is determined not only by the function we want to release, but also by the database itself. One of the challenges is to ensure that the noise magnitude does not leak information about the database. To address that, we calibrate the noise magnitude to the smooth sensitivity of f on the database x - a measure of variability of f in the neighborhood of the instance x. The new framework greatly expands the applicability of output perturbation, a technique for protecting individuals' privacy by adding a small amount of random noise to the released statistics. To our knowledge, this is the first formal analysis of the effect of instance-based noise in the context of data privacy. Our framework raises many interesting algorithmic questions. Narnely, to apply the framework one must compute or approximate the smooth sensitivity of f on x. We show how to do this efficiently for several different functions, including the median and the cost of the minimum spanning tree. We also give a generic procedure based on sampling that allows one to release f(x) accurately on many databases x. This procedure is applicable even when no efficient algorithm for approximating smooth sensitivity of f is known or when f is given as a black box. We illustrate the procedure by applying it to k-SED (k-means) Clustering and learning mixtures of Gaussians.},

In particular, these include privacy valuations that are based on ({\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}}, {\{}$\backslash$delta{\}})-differentially private mechanisms for non-zero {\{}$\backslash$delta{\}}, ones where the privacy costs are measured in a per-database manner (rather than taking the worst case), and ones that do not depend on the payments made to players (which might not be observable to an adversary). To bypass this impossibility result, we study a natural special setting where individuals have mono- tonic privacy valuations, which captures common contexts where certain values for private data are expected to lead to higher valuations for privacy (e.g. having a particular disease). We give new mech- anisms that are individually rational for all players with monotonic privacy valuations, truthful for all players whose privacy valuations are not too large, and accurate if there are not too many players with too-large privacy valuations. We also prove matching lower bounds showing that in some respects our mechanism cannot be improved significantly.},

The connection is a natural one, but its study has been jump-started in recent years by the advent of differential privacy, which provides a rigorous, quantitative way of reasoning about the costs that an agent might experience because of the loss of his privacy. Here, we survey several facets of this study, and differential privacy plays a role in more than one way. Of course, it provides us a basis for modeling agent costs for privacy, which is essential if we are to attempt mechanism design in a setting in which agents have preferences for privacy. It also provides a toolkit for controlling those costs. However, perhaps more surprisingly, it provides a powerful toolkit for controlling the stability of mechanisms in general, which yields a set of tools for designing novel mechanisms even in economic settings completely unrelated to privacy.},

  abstract    = {We provide a general framework for privacy-preserving variational Bayes (VB) for a large class of probabilistic models, called the conjugate exponential (CE) family. Our primary observation is that when models are in the CE family, we can privatise the variational posterior distributions simply by perturbing the expected sufficient statistics of the complete-data likelihood. For widely used non-CE models with binomial likelihoods, we exploit the P{\'o}lya-Gamma data augmentation scheme to bring such models into the CE family, such that inferences in the modified model resemble the private variational Bayes algorithm as closely as possible. The iterative nature of variational Bayes presents a further challenge since iterations increase the amount of noise needed. We overcome this by combining: (1) a relaxed notion of differential privacy, called concentrated differential privacy, which provides a tight bound on the privacy cost of multiple VB iterations and thus significantly decreases the amount of additive noise; and (2) the privacy amplification effect of subsampling mini-batches from large-scale data in stochastic learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in CE and non-CE models including latent Dirichlet allocation, Bayesian logistic regression, and sigmoid belief networks, evaluated on real-world datasets.},

There has traditionally been a reluctance to include such concerns primarily because models that included them often allow such a broad range of behavior that there are few, if any, restrictions on equilibrium behavior and, hence, such models would have little or no predictive power. In this paper we discuss how reduced form models may naturally give rise to utility functions that depend, in part, on relative standing. There are several advantages of modelling concern for relative standing in reduced form utility functions even when there is no similar concern in the 'deep' preferences. It provides structure and constraints on the way that relative standing affects utility, and further, it can yield testable implications about the way that changes in the underlying environment affect the concern for relative standing. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of modelling social concerns in this way and provide examples that illustrate how concerns for relative standing can affect savings, investment and labor choice decisions.},

and with different methods to allocate the privacy budget
among hierarchy levels. Our analysis and experimental re-

employing hierarchical methods beyond a single dimension

dimensions, it is almost always better to use the Flat method
instead of a hierarchy.},

Our guarantee is almost the best possible, even for non-interactive privacy mechanisms. Conceptually, the median mechanism is the first privacy mechanism capable of identifying and exploiting correlations among queries in an interactive setting. We also give an efficient implementation of the median mechanism, with running time polynomial in the number of queries, the database size, and the domain size. This efficient implementation guarantees privacy for all input databases, and accurate query results for almost all input databases. The dependence of the privacy on the number of queries in this mechanism improves over that of the best previously known efficient mechanism by a super-polynomial factor, even in the non-interactive setting.},

We organized sessions at the 2015 World Statistical Congress and the 2015 Joint Statistical Meetings, highlighting work on synthetic establishment microdata. This overview situates those papers, published in this issue, within the broader literature.},

A trusted data curator can increase the utility of data, while managing the risk to establishments, either by releasing synthetic data, or by infusing noise into published statistics. This paper evaluates the application of a differentially private mechanism to publish statistics on wages and job mobility computed from Brazilian employer-employee matched data. The publication mechanism can result in both the publication of specific statistics as well as the generation of synthetic data. I find that the tradeoff between the privacy guaranteed to individuals in the data, and the accuracy of published statistics, is potentially much better that the worst-case theoretical accuracy guarantee. However, the synthetic data fare quite poorly in analyses that are outside the set of queries to which it was trained. Note that this article only explores and characterizes the feasibility of these publication strategies, and will not directly result in the publication of any data.}

A fundamental and long-standing answer, at least for the case of supervised classification and regression, is that learnability is equivalent to uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk, and that if a problem is learnable, it is learnable via empirical risk minimization. In this paper, we consider the general learning setting (introduced by vapnik), which includes most statistical learning problems as special cases. We show that in this setting, there are non-trivial learning problems where uniform convergence does not hold, empirical risk minimization fails, and yet they are learnable using alternative mechanisms. Instead of uniform convergence, we identify stability as the key necessary and sufficient condition for learnability. Moreover, we show that the conditions for learnability in the general setting are significantly more complex than in supervised classification and regression.},

For instance, Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with a large penalty performs well for small models and poorly for large models, and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) does just the opposite. This article proposes an adaptive model selection procedure that uses a data-adaptive complexity penalty based on a concept of generalized degrees of freedom. The proposed procedure, combining the benefit of a class of nonadaptive procedures, approximates the best performance of this class of procedures across a variety of different situations. This class includes many well-known procedures, such as AIC, BIC, Mallows's Cp , and risk inflation criterion (RIC). The proposed procedure is applied to wavelet thresholding in nonparametric regression and variable selection in least squares regression. Simulation results and an asymptotic analysis support the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In some respects this interest in privacy is paradoxical, for the average citizen has more privacy-more areas of his life in which his behavior is not known by his fellows-than ever before. He lives in a large city, where no one is his keeper; in the small towns of former times privacy was won only by the cleverest people. He works in large organizations, and indeed he (or, more likely, some self-appointed spokesman) laments his alienation. He can shake off most of his past simply by moving-to the South, the West-and no earlier generation except the immigrant waves before World War I was as mobile.},

Since the data may contain sensitive information about individuals, and these analyses can leak that sensitive information, it is important to be able to solve convex minimization in a privacy-preserving way. A series of recent results show how to accurately solve a single convex minimization problem in a differentially private manner. However, the same data is often analyzed repeatedly, and little is known about solving multiple convex minimization problems with differential privacy. For simpler data analyses, such as linear queries, there are remarkable differentially private algorithms such as the private multiplicative weights mechanism (Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS 2010) that accurately answer exponentially many distinct queries. In this work, we extend these results to the case of convex minimization and show how to give accurate and differentially private solutions to *exponentially many* convex minimization problems on a sensitive dataset.},

Book: The rapid growth of electronic commerce, along with changes in information, computing, and communications, is having a profound effect on the United States economy. President Clinton recently directed the National Economic Council, in consultation with executive branch agencies, to analyze the economic implications of the Internet and electronic commerce domestically and internationally, and to consider new types of data collection and research that could be undertaken by public and private organizations. This book contains work presented at a conference held by executive branch agencies in May 1999 at the Department of Commerce. The goals of the conference were to assess current research on the digital economy, to engage the private sector in developing the research that informs investment and policy decisions, and to promote better understanding of the growth and socioeconomic implications of information technology and electronic commerce. Aspects of the digital economy addressed include macroeconomic assessment, organizational change, small business, access, market structure and competition, and employment and the workforce.},

I identify three circumstances where profits increase: (1) when the transactions cost of sharing is less than the marginal cost of production; (2) when content is viewed only a few times and transactions costs of sharing are low; and (3) when a sharing market provides a way to segment high-value and low-value users.},

How ironic that ICE-information, communication, and entertainment-now comprises the largest sector in the American economy. If information poses problems for economic theory, so much the worse for economic theory: real markets seem to deal with information rather well. This paradox is the central theme of this essay: information, that slippery and strange economic good, is, in fact, handled very well by market institutions. The reason is that real markets are much more creative than those simple competitive markets studied in Econ 1. The fact that real-life markets can handle a good as problematic as is a testament to the flexibility and robustness of market institutions.},

Specifically, we show that that under standard assumptions, getting one single sample from a posterior distribution is differentially private "for free". We will see that estimator is statistically consistent, near optimal and computationally tractable whenever the Bayesian model of interest is consistent, optimal and tractable. Similarly but separately, we show that a recent line of works that use stochastic gradient for Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling also preserve differentially privacy with minor or no modifications of the algorithmic procedure at all, these observations lead to an "anytime" algorithm for Bayesian learning under privacy constraint. We demonstrate that it performs much better than the state-of-the-art differential private methods on synthetic and real datasets.},

An example is a random mechanism that takes an input database X and outputs a random database Z according to a distribution Qn(*|X). Differential privacy is a particular privacy requirement developed by computer scientists in which Qn(*|X) is required to be insensitive to changes in one data point in X. This makes it difficult to infer from Z whether a given individual is in the original database X. We consider differential privacy from a statistical perspective. We consider several data-release mechanisms that satisfy the differential privacy requirement. We show that it is useful to compare these schemes by computing the rate of convergence of distributions and densities constructed from the released data. We study a general privacy method, called the exponential mechanism, introduced by McSherry and Talwar (2007). We show that the accuracy of this method is intimately linked to the rate at which the probability that the empirical distribution concentrates in a small ball around the true distribution.},

This paper investigates public good provision and excess burden in a model that allows for interdependence in consumption in the form of status (relative consumption) effects. In the presence of such effects, consumption and labor taxes no longer are pure distortionary taxes but have a corrective tax element that addresses an externality from consumption. As a result, the marginal excess burden of consumption taxes is lower than in the absence of status effects, and will be negative if the consumption tax rate is below the "Pigouvian" rate. Correspondingly, when consumption or labor tax rates are below the Pigouvian rate, the second-best level of public goods provision is above the first-best level, contrary to findings from models without status effects. For plausible functional forms and parameters relating to status effects, the marginal excess burden from existing U.S. labor taxes is substantially lower than in most prior studies, and is negative in some cases.},

This concept is often used for measurement of model complexity, for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the error variance, and for comparison of different models.

The definition is based on the sum of the sensitivity of each fitted value to perturbation in the corresponding observed value. The concept is nonasymptotic in nature and does not require analytic knowledge of the modeling procedures. The concept of GDF offers a unified framework under which complex and highly irregular modeling procedures can be analyzed in the same way as classical linear models. By using this framework, many difficult problems can be solved easily. For example, one can now measure the number of observations used in a variable selection process. Different modeling procedures, such as a tree-based regression and a projection pursuit regression, can be compared on the basis of their residual sums of squares and the GDF that they cost. I apply the proposed framework to measure the effect of variable selection in linear models, leading to corrections of selection bias in various goodness-of-fit statistics.

(PLoS Genetics, 2008), who considered the case of 1-way marginals of SNP allele frequencies obtained in a genome-wide association study: Given a large number of minor allele frequencies from a case group of individuals diagnosed with a particular disease, together with the genomic data of a single target individual and statistics from a sizable reference dataset independently drawn from the same population, an attacker can determine with high confidence whether or not the target is in the case group. In this work we describe and analyze a simple attack that succeeds even if the summary statistics are significantly distorted, whether due to measurement error or noise intentionally introduced to protect privacy. Our attack only requires that the vector of distorted summary statistics is close to the vector of true marginals in L1 norm. Moreover, the reference pool required by previous attacks can be replaced by a single sample drawn from the underlying population. The new attack, which is not specific to genomics and which handles Gaussian as well as Bernouilli data, significantly generalizes recent lower bounds on the noise needed to ensure differential privacy (Bun, Ullman, and Vadhan, STOC 2014, Steinke and Ullman, 2015), obviating the need for the attacker to control the exact distribution of the data.},

One approach with the potential for overcoming these risks is to release synthetic data; that is, the released establishment data are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the distributions of the underlying real microdata. In this article, we describe an application of this strategy to create a public use file for the Longitudinal Business Database, an annual economic census of establishments in the United States comprising more than 20 million records dating back to 1976. The U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Internal Revenue Service recently approved the release of these synthetic microdata for public use, making the synthetic Longitudinal Business Database the first-ever business microdata set publicly released in the United States. We describe how we created the synthetic data, evaluated analytical validity, and assessed disclosure risk.},

	abstract = {National statistical agencies around the world publish tabular summaries based on combined employer-employee (ER-EE) data. The privacy of both individuals and business establishments that feature in these data are protected by law in most countries. These data are currently released using a variety of statistical disclosure limitation (SDL) techniques that do not reveal the exact characteristics of particular employers and employees, but lack provable privacy guarantees limiting inferential disclosures.
	In this work, we present novel algorithms for releasing tabular summaries of linked ER-EE data with formal, provable guarantees of privacy. We show that state-of-the-art differentially private algorithms add too much noise for the output to be useful. Instead, we identify the privacy requirements mandated by current interpretations of the relevant laws, and formalize them using the Pufferfish framework. We then develop new privacy definitions that are customized to ER-EE data and satisfy the statutory privacy requirements. We implement the experiments in this paper on production data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau. An empirical evaluation of utility for these data shows that for reasonable values of the privacy-loss parameter $\epsilon\geq$ 1, the additive error introduced by our provably private algorithms is comparable, and in some cases better, than the error introduced by existing SDL techniques that have no provable privacy guarantees. For some complex queries currently published, however, our algorithms do not have utility comparable to the existing traditional SDL algorithms. Those queries are fodder for future research.},

Recently emerging from the theoretical computer science literature, differential privacy is now in initial stages of implementation and use in various academic, industry, and government settings. Using intuitive illustrations and limited mathematical formalism, this document provides an introduction to differential privacy for non-technical practitioners, who are increasingly tasked with making decisions with respect to differential privacy as it grows more widespread in use. In particular, the examples in this document illustrate ways in which social scientists can conceptualize the guarantees provided by differential privacy with respect to the decisions they make when managing personal data about research subjects and informing them about the privacy protection they will be afforded.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;},

Here, we report findings about the performance of four online sources for recruiting iPhone users to participate in a web survey. The findings reveal very different performances between two types of strategies: those that "pull in" online users actively looking for paid work (MTurk workers and Craigslist users) and those that "push out" a recruiting ad to online users engaged in other, unrelated online activities (Google AdWords and Facebook). The pull-method recruits were more cost efficient and committed to the survey task, while the push-method recruits were more demographically diverse. },

  abstract  = {Background: Interviewer-administered surveys are an important method of collecting population-level epidemiological data, but suffer from declining response rates and increasing costs. Web surveys offer more rapid data collection and lower costs. There are concerns, however, about data quality from web surveys. Previous research has largely focused on selection biases, and few have explored measurement differences. This paper aims to assess the extent to which mode affects the responses given by the same respondents at two points in time, providing information on potential measurement error if web surveys are used in the future.   Methods: 527 participants from the third British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3), which uses computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) and self-interview (CASI) modes, subsequently responded to identically-worded questions in a web survey. McNemar tests assessed whether within-person differences in responses were at random or indicated a mode effect, i.e. higher reporting of more sensitive responses in one mode. An analysis of pooled responses by generalized estimating equations addressed the impact of gender and question type on change.   Results: Only 10 percent of responses changed between surveys. However mode effects were found for about a third of variables, with higher reporting of sensitive responses more commonly found on the web compared with Natsal-3.   Conclusions The web appears a promising mode for surveys of sensitive behaviours, most likely as part of a mixed-mode design. Our findings suggest that mode effects may vary by question type and content, and by the particular mix of modes used. Mixed-mode surveys need careful development to understand mode effects and how to account for them.},

Although survey-based studies have examined links between public perceptions of hot weather and climate change beliefs, relatively little is known about people's perceptions of changes in flood risks, the extent to which climate change is perceived to contribute to changes in flood risks, or how such perceptions vary by political affiliation. We discuss findings from a survey of long-time residents of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, a region that has experienced regular flooding. Our participants perceived local flood risks as having increased and expected further increase in the future; expected higher future flood risks if they believed more in the contribution of climate change; interpreted projections of future increases in flooding as evidence for climate change; and perceived similar increases in flood risks independent of their political affiliation despite disagreeing about climate change. Overall, these findings suggest that communications about climate change adaptation will be more effective if they focus more on protection against local flood risks, especially when targeting audiences of potential climate sceptics.},

  abstract = {Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfully applied to a range of data analysis tasks. We describe the matrix mechanism, an algorithm for answering a workload of linear counting queries that adapts the noise distribution to properties of the provided queries. Given a workload, the mechanism uses a different set of queries, called a query strategy, which are answered using a standard Laplace or Gaussian mechanism. Noisy answers to the workload queries are then derived from the noisy answers to the strategy queries. This two-stage process can result in a more complex, correlated noise distribution that preserves differential privacy but increases accuracy. We provide a formal analysis of the error of query answers produced by the mechanism and investigate the problem of computing the optimal query strategy in support of a given workload. We show that this problem can be formulated as a rank-constrained semidefinite program. We analyze two seemingly distinct techniques proposed in the literature, whose similar behavior is explained by viewing them as instances of the matrix mechanism. We also describe an extension of the mechanism in which nonnegativity constraints are included in the derivation process and provide experimental evidence of its efficacy.},

abstract={Differential privacy is widely accepted as a powerful framework for providing strong, formal privacy guarantees for aggregate data analysis. A limitation of the model is that the same level of privacy protection is afforded for all individuals. However, it is common that the data subjects have quite different expectations regarding the acceptable level of privacy for their data. Consequently, differential privacy may lead to insufficient privacy protection for some users, while over-protecting others. We argue that by accepting that not all users require the same level of privacy, a higher level of utility can often be attained by not providing excess privacy to those who do not want it. We propose a new privacy definition called personalized differential privacy (PDP), a generalization of differential privacy in which users specify a personal privacy requirement for their data. We then introduce several novel mechanisms for achieving PDP. Our primary mechanism is a general one that automatically converts any existing differentially private algorithm into one that satisfies PDP. We also present a more direct approach for achieving PDP, inspired by the well-known exponential mechanism. We demonstrate our framework through extensive experiments on real and synthetic data.},

  abstract  = {There has been increasing interest in the problem of building accurate data mining models over aggregate data, while protecting privacy at the level of individual records. One approach for this problem is to randomize the values in individual records, and only disclose the randomized values. The model is then built over the randomized data, after first compensating for the randomization (at the aggregate level). This approach is potentially vulnerable to privacy breaches: based on the distribution of the data, one may be able to learn with high confidence that some of the randomized records satisfy a specified property, even though privacy is preserved on average.In this paper, we present a new formulation of privacy breaches, together with a methodology, "amplification", for limiting them. Unlike earlier approaches, amplification makes it is possible to guarantee limits on privacy breaches without any knowledge of the distribution of the original data. We instantiate this methodology for the problem of mining association rules, and modify the algorithm from [9] to limit privacy breaches without knowledge of the data distribution. Next, we address the problem that the amount of randomization required to avoid privacy breaches (when mining association rules) results in very long transactions. By using pseudorandom generators and carefully choosing seeds such that the desired items from the original transaction are present in the randomized transaction, we can send just the seed instead of the transaction, resulting in a dramatic drop in communication and storage cost. Finally, we define new information measures that take privacy breaches into account when quantifying the amount of privacy preserved by randomization.},

The target application for this work is a mapping program that shows the commuting patterns of the population of the United States. The source data for this application were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, but due to privacy constraints, they cannot be used directly by the mapping program. Instead, we generate synthetic data that statistically mimic the original data while providing privacy guarantees. We use these synthetic data as a surrogate for the original data. We find that while some existing definitions of privacy are inapplicable to our target application, others are too conservative and render the synthetic data useless since they guard against privacy breaches that are very unlikely. Moreover, the data in our target application is sparse, and none of the existing solutions are tailored to anonymize sparse data. In this paper, we propose solutions to address the above issues.},

The concept of a social licence describes how the expectations of society regarding some activities may go beyond compliance with the requirements of formal regulation; those who do not fulfil the conditions for the social licence (even if formally compliant) may experience ongoing challenge and contestation. Previous work suggests that people{\textquoteright}s cooperation with specific research studies depends on their perceptions that their participation is voluntary and is governed by values of reciprocity, non-exploitation and service of the public good. When these conditions are not seen to obtain, threats to the social licence for research may emerge. We propose that care.data failed to adequately secure a social licence because of: (i) defects in the warrants of trust provided for care.data, (ii) the implied rupture in the traditional role, expectations and duties of general practitioners, and (iii) uncertainty about the status of care.data as a public good. The concept of a social licence may be useful in explaining the specifics of care.data, and also in reinforcing the more general lesson for policy-makers that legal authority does not necessarily command social legitimacy.},

              The purpose of doing this is to protect the confidentiality of
              respondents' identities and sensitive attributes, while allowing
              standard complete-data analyses of microdata. A key challenge,
              faced by advocates of synthetic data, is demonstrating that valid
              statistical inferences can be obtained from such synthetic data
              for non-confidential questions. Large discrepancies between
              observed-data and synthetic-data analytic results for such
              questions may arise because of uncongeniality; that is,
              differences in the types of inputs available to the imputer, who
              has access to the actual data, and to the analyst, who has access
              only to the synthetic data. Here, we discuss a simple, but
              possibly canonical, example of uncongeniality when using multiple
              imputation to create synthetic data, which specifically addresses
              the choices made by the imputer. An initial, unanticipated but
              not surprising, conclusion is that non-confidential design
              information used to impute synthetic data should be released with
              the confidential synthetic data to allow users of synthetic data
              to avoid possible grossly conservative inferences.},

The multiplicative weights framework allows us to maintain and improve a distribution approximating a given data set with respect to a set of counting queries. We use the exponential mechanism to select those queries most incorrectly tracked by the current distribution. Combing the two, we quickly approach a distribution that agrees with the data set on the given set of queries up to small error. The resulting algorithm and its analysis is simple, but nevertheless improves upon previous work in terms of both error and running time. We also empirically demonstrate the practicality of our approach on several data sets commonly used in the statistical community for contingency table release.},

Specifically, we show that the recent notion of differential privacv, in addition to its own intrinsic virtue, can ensure that participants have limited effect on the outcome of the mechanism, and as a consequence have limited incentive to lie. More precisely, mechanisms with differential privacy are approximate dominant strategy under arbitrary player utility functions, are automatically resilient to coalitions, and easily allow repeatability. We study several special cases of the unlimited supply auction problem, providing new results for digital goods auctions, attribute auctions, and auctions with arbitrary structural constraints on the prices. As an important prelude to developing a privacy-preserving auction mechanism, we introduce and study a generalization of previous privacy work that accommodates the high sensitivity of the auction setting, where a single participant may dramatically alter the optimal fixed price, and a slight change in the offered price may take the revenue from optimal to zero.},

  abstract  = {Author Summary In this report we describe a framework for accurately and robustly resolving whether individuals are in a complex genomic DNA mixture using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping microarrays. We develop a theoretical framework for detecting an individual's presence within a mixture, show its limits through simulation, and finally demonstrate experimentally the identification of the presence of genomic DNA of individuals within a series of highly complex genomic mixtures. Our approaches demonstrate straightforward identification of trace amounts (<1 pct) of DNA from an individual contributor within a complex mixture. We show how probe-intensity analysis of high-density SNP data can be used, even given the experimental noise of a microarray. We discuss the implications of these findings in two fields: forensics and genome-wide association (GWA) genetic studies. Within forensics, resolving whether an individual is contributing trace amounts of genomic DNA to a complex mixture is a tremendous challenge. Within GWA studies, there is a considerable push to make experimental data publicly available so that the data can be combined with other studies. Our findings show that such an approach does not completely conceal identity, since it is straightforward to assess the probability that a person or relative participated in a GWA study.},

abstract={While re-identification of sensitive data has been studied extensively, with the emergence of online social networks and the popularity of digital communications, the ability to use public data for re-identification has increased. This work begins by presenting two different cases studies for sensitive data re-identification. We conclude that targeted re-identification using traditional variables is not only possible, but fairly straightforward given the large amount of public data available. However, our first case study also indicates that large-scale re-identification is less likely. We then consider methods for agencies such as the Census Bureau to identify variables that cause individuals to be vulnerable without testing all combinations of variables. We show the effectiveness of different strategies on a Census Bureau data set and on a synthetic data set.},

  abstract = {Advertisers use online customer data to target their marketing appeals. This has heightened consumers' privacy concerns, leading governments to pass laws designed to protect consumer privacy by restricting the use of data and by restricting online tracking techniques used by websites. We use the responses of 3.3 million survey takers who had been randomly exposed to 9,596 online display (banner) advertising campaigns to explore how privacy regulation in the European Union (EU) has influenced advertising effectiveness. This privacy regulation restricted advertisers' ability to collect data on Web users in order to target ad campaigns. We find that, on average, display advertising became far less effective at changing stated purchase intent after the EU laws were enacted, relative to display advertising in other countries. The loss in effectiveness was more pronounced for websites that had general content (such as news sites), where non-data-driven targeting is particularly hard to do. The loss of effectiveness was also more pronounced for ads with a smaller presence on the webpage and for ads that did not have additional interactive, video, or audio features. This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing.},

Our results suggest that the commonly used consent-based approach may disproportionately benefit firms that offer a larger scope of services. Therefore, though privacy regulation imposes costs on all firms, it is small firms and new firms that are most adversely affected. We then show that this negative effect will be particularly severe for goods where the price mechanism does not mediate the effect, such as the advertising-supported Internet.},

  abstract    = {Manufacturing in America has become significantly more data-intensive. We investigate the adoption, performance effects and organizational complementarities of data-driven decision making (DDD) in the U.S. Using data collected by the Census Bureau for 2005 and 2010, we observe the extent to which manufacturing firms track and use data to guide decision making, as well as their investments in information technology (IT) and the use of other structured management practices. Examining a representative sample of over 18,000 plans, we find that adoption of DDD is earlier and more prevalent among larger, older plants belonging to multi-unit firms. Smaller single-establishment firms adopt later but have a higher correlation with performance than similar non-adopters. Using a fixed-effects estimator, we find the average value-added for later DDD adopters to be 3% greater than non-adopters, controlling for other inputs to production. This effect is distinct from that associated with IT and other structured management practices and is concentrated among single-unit firms. Performance improves after plants adopt DDD, but not before ? consistent with a causal relationship. However, DDD-related performance differentials decrease over time for early and late adopters, consistent with firm learning and development of organizational complementarities. Formal complementarity tests suggest that DDD and high levels of IT capital reinforce each other, as do DDD and skilled workers. For some industries, the benefits of DDD adoption appear to be greater for plants that delegate some decision making to frontline workers.},

Any information obtained in the screening process may be traded to another firm selling related products. We show that firms' ability to sell consumer information can lead to lower prices, higher screening intensities, and increased social welfare. By exploiting variations in the adoption of local financial-privacy ordinances in five California Bay Area counties, we are able to provide simple estimates of the effects of stricter financial-privacy laws on mortgage denial rates during 2001?2006. Consistent with the model's predictions, denial rates for home-purchase loans and refinancing loans decreased in counties where opt-in privacy ordinances were adopted. Moreover, estimated foreclosure start rates during the financial crisis of 2007?2008 were higher in counties where the privacy ordinance was adopted.},
